### Creating a file from Upstream

## Tried almost all git commands
```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git clone repo
  git commit -m 
  git push 
  git checkout <branch>
  git revert <commit hash>
```
## I am also going to be trying this commands after creating this file
```bash
  git pull
  git fetch
  git merge <branch_name> // to merge my feature branch to main
```

And then after I will merge my feature branch to my main and push to the repo
